# Inventory-JavaScript
Build a Node.js module that is designed to track inventory for a store.

Content

A Node.js module called inventory.js that exposes the following functionality:

● addItem - A function that takes 2 parameters: an item’s name and price and tracks it internally.

● items - A function that returns a list of items, sorted by price from least expensive to most expensive.

● getMostExpensive - Returns an object that contains the item’s name and price for the most expensive item that has been added.

● getLeastExpensive - Returns an object that contains the item’s name and price for the most least expensive item that has been added.

● removeItem - Remove an item by name.

● getItemByName - Returns an item’s name and price by name.

● getItemByPrice - Returns an item’s name and price by price.

Your module should not expose any functions or variables that would allow the above functions to have the integrity of their data compromised.
